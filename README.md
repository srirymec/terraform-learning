## What Is Terraform?

Terraform is one of the most popular Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, used by DevOps teams to automate infrastructure tasks. It is used to automate the provisioning of your cloud resources. Terraform is an open-source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool developed by HashiCorp and written in GO language.

## Terraform Lifecycle

Terraform lifecycle consists of â€“ **init**, **plan**, **apply**, and **destroy**.

![Terraform life cycle](https://github.com/srirymec/terraform-learning/blob/main/terraform-lifecycle.png)

- **Terraform init** initializes the (local) Terraform environment. Usually executed only once per session.
- **Terraform plan** compares the Terraform state with the as-is state in the cloud, build and display an execution plan. This does not change the deployment (read-only).
- **Terraform apply** executes the plan. This potentially changes the deployment.
- **Terraform destroy** deletes all resources that are governed by this specific terraform environment.

## Terraform Core Concepts

- **Variables:** Terraform has input and output variables, it is a key-value pair.<br/>

  **variables.tf**
  ```
  variable "prefix" { 
     default = ["Mr", "Mrs", "Sir"] 
      type = list 
  } 
  ```

  **Supported variable types**

  > - string 
  > - number 
  > - bool 
  > - any 
  > - list 
  > - map 
  > - object 
  > - tuple 
  
- **Provider:** Terraform users provision their infrastructure on the major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, OCI, and others. A provider is a plugin that interacts with the various APIs required to create, update, and delete various resources.
  ```
  Terraform { 
    required_providers { 
         local = { 
             source = "hashicorp/local" 
             version = "1.4.0" ("!=2.0.0" | "< 1.4.0" | "> 1.1.0" | "> 1.2.0, < 2.0.0, != 1.4.0"| "~> 1.2") 
         } 
     } 
  }
  ```
- **Module:** Any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module. 
- **State:** Terraform records information about what infrastructure is created in a Terraform state file. 
- **Resources:** Cloud Providers provides various services in their offerings, they are referenced as Resources in Terraform. 
- **Data Source:** Data source performs a read-only operation. It allows data to be fetched or computed from resources/entities that are not defined or managed by Terraform or the current Terraform configuration.
- **Plan:** It is one of the stages in the Terraform lifecycle where it determines what needs to be created, updated, or destroyed to move from the real/current state of the infrastructure to the desired state.
- **Apply:** It is one of the stages in the Terraform lifecycle where it applies the changes real/current state of the infrastructure in order to achieve the desired state.

## Terraform Configuration Files

- **Configuration file (*.tf files):** Here we declare the provider and resources to be deployed along with the type of resource and all resources specific settings
- **Variable declaration file (variables.tf or variables.tf.json):** Here we declare the input variables required to provision resources
- **Variable definition files (terraform.tfvars):** Here we assign values to the input variables
- **State file (terraform.tfstate):** a state file is created once after Terraform is run. It stores state about our managed infrastructure.

**variables.tf**
  ```
  variable "prefix" { 
     default = ["Mr", "Mrs", "Sir"] 
      type = list 
  } 
 
  variable "length" { 
     default = 2 
     type = number 
     description = "" 
  } 
  ```

  **main.tf**
  ```
  resource "random_pet" "mypet"{ 
     prefix = var.prefix[0] 
     length = var.length 
  }
  ```
